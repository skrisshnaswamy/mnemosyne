A "gate" in a neural network is a mechanism that learns to control the flow of information. It acts like a smart valve, deciding how much of a certain signal should be let through.

### From Kidan
- Kidan's CM2 Encoder used a gate in its feed-forward layer.
- This is often more complex and memory-intensive than a simple [[ReLU Activation]], contributing to its poor performance.
