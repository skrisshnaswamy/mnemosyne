So technically in simple / early math, the variable X refers to an unknown thing. But in stats, we've another kind of variable called the random variable 'X'. This is slightly different. It's actually a process or function being represented as a variable.
A good example to understand a random variable or process is -
Say you commute from home to work by walk every day. It's a distance of 1.2km as per google maps. But the time taken to commute can be modeled as a random variable X. The reason it is a random variable or a random process is because the outcome here is not deterministic but probabilistic / stochastic. Meaning there could be `n` number of things or events that can happen in between which changes the time taken to commute. Although the distance travelled is somewhat deterministic (again this also can be a random process given it totally depends on how many signals and crossings there are from Point A to Point B) , but circling back, even if the distance travelled is deterministic, the time taken is affected by the state of the signals when you reach a pedestrian crossing, whether or not, the footpath was crowded with other fellow pedestrians, priority users like old folks, or even cyclists and other unknowns.
