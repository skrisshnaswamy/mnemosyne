This is a common failure reasons typically seen in [[Generative Models]] esp. in [[Generative Adverserial Network]]. Well, even if it's mostly known in GANs, it can also be seen in any generative models.

Typically happens when your model learns to produce only a limited subset of output rather than the rich varied set of output it is trained on.
Like, the model is trained to generate dogs, cats and hamsters, but then it only generate cats.
